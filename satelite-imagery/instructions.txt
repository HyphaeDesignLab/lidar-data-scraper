Decided to use UP42 and Apollo Mapping.
The satellite accuracy: under 50 cm (30 cm seems ideal)
Don’t use PAN imagery
Use at least 4 bands of spectral reading
Use under 10% cloud cover esp if the area of interest overlaps close to fully with the satellite image area
Use less than 30 degrees of pitch/incline of the photo angle from vertical: NADIR

Stereo NOT needed; so if it makes it more expensive and there are alternatives, use those

Prefer to use same season on SAME YEAR, if same year not available; if not, try same season in a different year;
Seasons are: “leaves ON” (05/01 to end of 09/30) and “leaves OFF” (11/01 to end of 3/31)
